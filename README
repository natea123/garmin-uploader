# Garmin Uploader

Garmin Uploader is a Python application designed to backup your activities (as gpx files) to a Google Cloud Storage Bucket. 


## Usage

Create a service account in your GCP project with the Storage Admin role and download the json key locally as garmin-uploader.json [guide](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reference/libraries#setting_up_authentication)

Create a .env file with the following variables as strings:
BUCKET => name of GCS bucket
GARMIN_EMAIL => Garmin Connect email
GARMIN_PW => Garmin Connect password
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="./garmin-uploader.json"

python3 garmin_uploader.py

## Roadmap

I plan to iterate on this application and add functionality to run this as a Cloud Run service using Secrets Manager for additional security. Additionally, I plan to include a front end service to visualize the gpx files from the bucket.
